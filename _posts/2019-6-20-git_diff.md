To use git diff more efficiently, we actually have to understand different stages of git files.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/stages_of_git_files.png){: .align-center}

Then we can use git diff to show changes between different stages. Here, **HEAD** corresponds to **Committed** tip, **Index** corresponds to **Staged**, **Modified** corresponds to **Working tree**.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/git_diff.png){: .align-center}
